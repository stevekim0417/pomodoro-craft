## ✨ What makes it different

- **Cozy pixel-art world** — Steve (now wearing a red baseball cap 🧢) stands in front of a growing biome that reacts to your focus sessions
- **5 swappable biomes** — Tomato 🍅 (default), Diamond 💎, Emerald 💚, Gold 🟡, Ruby ❤️ — each with its own particle colors, drop item, hill palette, and harvest icon
- **Harvest inventory** — every completed focus session drops one fruit/gem of the current theme into today's harvest row
- **Companion Mode** — a fullscreen, UI-less layout you can drop into OBS or use as a YouTube live stream background
- **URL presets** — share a link like `?focus=50&theme=ruby&autostart=1` and the timer starts that exact session on click
- **Social proof counter** — `🌱 N focusing now` gives you a sense you're not studying alone
- **Zero dependencies** — a single `index.html` file, no build tools, no frameworks, open and focus

## 🧩 Features

### Focus Mode (day)
- Steve swings his pickaxe with a downward arc + body lean
- A procedural hill grows beside him — each theme paints the hill with its own biome palette (grass, moss, sand, cave rock, tomato garden)
- Dirt chunks fly from Steve to the hill in parabolic arcs
- Creeper occasionally peeks from behind a tree
- **HARVEST row** — every focus session drops one themed icon into today's inventory

### Break Mode (night)
- Night sky with twinkling stars and moon
- Steve rests by a flickering campfire
- Wolf companion with tail-wagging animation
- Floating fireflies and rising embers
- ZZZ sleep bubbles and stretch animations
- Chicken walks across the scene
- Lo-fi music auto-plays during breaks (togglable)

### Timer
- Configurable focus (1–180 min), short break (1–60 min), long break (1–120 min)
- 8-slot hotbar tracks sessions per cycle; long break every 4 sessions
- Block-style progress bar
- Browser notifications when a session ends
- Auto-break / auto-focus toggles for continuous sessions

### Theme picker (5 biomes)
Switch via the **ORE THEME** row in the settings drawer. Each theme updates:
- Ore color
- Drop item sprite + colors
- Hotbar icon
- Hill biome palette (repaints existing hill on theme switch)
- Per-swing particle colors
- Harvest emoji

Theme is **not persisted** — Tomato is the app's identity and always loads on refresh.

### Share button
One click opens a prefilled social share:
- Mobile: native Web Share API (kakao / Insta / iMessage)
- Desktop: Twitter intent URL
- Text is auto-generated from today's harvest count and focus minutes

### Daily stats
- Today's completed sessions, focus/break minutes, blocks mined
- Harvest row with theme icon
- Auto-resets daily, persisted in `localStorage`
